This plugin is superseded by vimscript #1431.

This ftplugin is based on Klaus Horsten's php_console (vimscript #779). In 
opposition to php_console, it only checks the syntax. It does this automatically
when opening or closing a file.

If you use this as a ftplugin, the script will miss the first BufRead event 
as this is when it's being loaded.

If php isn't in your path, set the g:php_check_syntax_cmd variable 
(including the -l switch).
